# My Project

This project uses [MkDocs Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) to generate a static site.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- `pip` (Python package installer)

## Installation

1. Install MkDocs and the Material theme:

    ```bash
    pip install mkdocs-material
    ```

2. Create a new MkDocs project:

    ```bash
    mkdocs new my-project
    cd my-project
    ```

3. Replace the `mkdocs.yml` with the following content:

    ```yaml
    site_name: My Project
    theme:
      name: material
    ```

## Usage

1. To serve the site locally:

    ```bash
    mkdocs serve
    ```

    Open `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` in your browser to view the site.

2. To build the site:

    mkdocs build
    mkdocs serve
    ```

    The static site will be generated in the `site` directory.
